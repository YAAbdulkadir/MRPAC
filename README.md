# MRPAC
## A desktop application program for autocontouring DICOM images sent over a DICOM Network.

MRPAC is written in python and it automatically contours DICOM images that are sent to it over a [DICOM](https://www.dicomstandard.org/) communication protocol. It converts the autocontour results as [`DICOM RT Structure Set`](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.19.3.html#table_A.19.3-1) and sends them to a pre-configured DICOM location. 

## Installation
To install MRPAC, I suggest you create a separate virtual environment first. Then simply clone the repository (or download the zip file) and run the following command in your terminal/command prompt: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
If you would like to use our models that were trained on MR images of the pelvis from a 0.35T scanner, you can download them from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jiswRsa59ADvz7HG5iFQ_KxpS1M2I_zW?usp=drive_link). You must create a directory called models and copy all the models into that directory. The details about the models can be found [here](). If you have your own models that you would like to use, follow the instruction below.

## Starting MRPAC
In order to start the program, you simply run the `MRPAC.py` file in the `src` directory as follows:
```bash
cd src
python MRPAC.py
```
## Configuration
When you run the progrom, you will be prompted to login. The default username and password are Admin and mrpac respectively (The feature to add or modify users is not implemented yet).

After you successfully login, you will see the `Setup` window which should look like the following:

In the SCP Details section, you can type in the AE title you would like to use for this program. (Make sure it complies with the DICOM standard as specified [here](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part08.html#chapter_C)). You alse need to choose a port number (choose a port above 1024 that is not being used by other programs). You can save your AE title and port number so that the next time you run the program, it remembers. When you click on the Start SCP button, the server will be started and will start listening for DICOM communications with the specified AET and port number. Once active, the SCP Status will change to `Active` as shown below.

It does support a DICOM [C-ECHO](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part07/sect_9.3.5.html) so you can try and verify that other DICOM applications are able to communicate with your program. Now your program is configured to accept MR images that are sent to it and generate the autocontours. To automatically send the DICOM [RTStruct](https://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.19.html) that is generated by this program to a DICOM location (such as a PACS), you need to add the information of the DICOM location in the `Server Details` section by clicking on the `Config...` button. This will take you to a new window which should look like this.

You can add multiple DICOM locations in here and they will be saved, however, you can only select one DICOM location to send the `RTStruct` files to. In order to add a DICOM location, you simply click on the `Add` button which will take you to the `Add window`.

![add](screencaptures/add.PNG).

You can add the details of the DICOM location in here and click on `Verify connection` to verify the connection by sending a DICOM C-ECHO message before adding it. Once you have successfully added as many DICOM locations as you like, you can select one of them where the `RTStruct` will be sent to.

## Using your own models
If you have your own autocontouring models that you would like to use instead, you can modify `Autocontour.py`. You can follow a similar structure and implement the `__init__` method and the `run` method. If you change the structure of the `Autocontour` class, you might have to modify `MRPAC.py` to make sure that it is being instantiated and run correctly in the `handle_close` function.
